## Sub-Heading ##

	All the benefits of owning a pool without actually having to own a pool.

## Summary ##

	RentMyPool allows people with unused swimming pools to connect with those wanting to swim but who don't have a pool of thier own. 

## Problem ##

	Most residential swimming pools sit empty of people for much of the year. Owning and maintaining a pool can be expensive even when it is not in use. Having a pool sit empty is a waste of resources especially when ther are so many people who would love access to a swimming pool but are prohibited from ever owning thier own. 

## Solution ##

	RentMyPool allows pool owners to make extra income by renting out thier swimming pools during the time thier are not being used. This gives a unique opportuniy for those who only want tempory access to a private pool by alowing them to rent someones unused pool by the day. This helps the owner with maintence costs by selling the unused pool time to those wanting to swim.
